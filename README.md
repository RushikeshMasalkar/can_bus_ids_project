## Why This Matters

Modern vehicles are rolling networks. Every time you brake, accelerate, or turn the wheel, dozens of **Electronic Control Units (ECUs)** exchange thousands of messages per second over the **Controller Area Network (CAN) bus** — a protocol designed in 1986 that ships with:

- No message authentication
- No sender verification
- No encryption of any kind

A single compromised ECU, a malicious OBD-II dongle, or a rogue Bluetooth module gives an attacker **unrestricted write access** to safety-critical systems including brakes, steering, throttle, and transmission. High-profile demonstrations by Miller & Valasek (Jeep Cherokee, 2015) proved this is not theoretical — they remotely disabled brakes and took control of steering at highway speed.

**This project builds a production-grade, real-time IDS that requires zero labeled attack data during training** — learning only what "normal" looks like, and flagging everything that deviates. When an anomaly is confirmed, a second-stage classifier identifies the exact attack type with fine-grained accuracy.

---

## Project Overview

This repository implements a **two-stage AI pipeline** for CAN bus intrusion detection:

| Stage | Task | Model | Trigger |
|:------|:-----|:------|:--------|
| **Stage 1** | Binary: Normal vs. Attack | DistilBERT (MLM, reconstruction loss) | Always runs on every window |
| **Stage 2** | Multiclass: Exact attack type | RandomForest + TF-IDF + numeric features | Only when Stage 1 flags ATTACK |

The system is served through a **FastAPI backend** with REST and WebSocket endpoints, and visualized in a **React + TypeScript SOC-style dashboard** with live stream monitoring, manual sequence analysis, and downloadable evaluation reports.

The entire approach is grounded in a linguistic analogy:

| NLP Concept | CAN Bus Equivalent |
|:------------|:-------------------|
| Word | CAN ID (hex → integer token) |
| Sentence | Sequence of CAN frames (window = 64) |
| Vocabulary | All unique CAN IDs observed in normal traffic |
| Grammar | Temporal ordering patterns of CAN IDs |
| Anomaly | Frame sequence that violates the learned grammar |

The model **never sees attack data during training**. It learns the statistical "language" of a healthy CAN bus through Masked Language Modeling. Attack frames — with injected, out-of-distribution IDs — produce high reconstruction loss because the model has never learned to predict them.

---

## System Architecture — The 2-Stage Pipeline

### Stage 1: Anomaly Detection via Reconstruction Loss

DistilBERT is fine-tuned on **normal CAN traffic only** using a Masked Language Modeling objective — randomly masking 15% of CAN ID tokens in each window and training the model to predict them from context.

At inference time:
1. A sliding window (size = 64, stride = 1) segments incoming CAN traffic into overlapping sequences
2. Each sequence passes through the trained model
3. **Cross-entropy reconstruction loss** is computed per sequence
4. If `loss > threshold` (the 99th percentile of normal traffic losses, stored in `threshold.json`) → flagged as **ATTACK**

This approach is entirely **unsupervised with respect to attack types** — it is inherently robust to zero-day attack variants never seen during training.

### Stage 2: Multiclass Attack Classification

When Stage 1 confirms an anomaly, Stage 2 activates:

1. The flagged sequence is featurized using:
   - **TF-IDF** over the string representation of the CAN ID sequence
   - **Numeric statistical features** (mean, variance, entropy of token distribution, unique token count)
2. A **RandomForest classifier** predicts one of four attack types:

| Label | Attack Description |
|:------|:-------------------|
| `DoS` | High-priority frame flooding to starve legitimate messages off the bus |
| `Fuzzy` | Injection of random/spoofed CAN IDs and data payloads |
| `RPM` | Forging engine RPM sensor messages to manipulate driver perception |
| `Gear` | Forging transmission gear position messages |

Stage 2 **only triggers on confirmed anomalies** — keeping inference overhead negligible on normal traffic.

## Data Pipeline

### 🗂️ Data Architecture & Pipeline Artifacts

This project enforces strict data immutability for source captures and relies on an automated preprocessing and compilation pipeline to produce machine-learning-ready assets. Raw Car-Hacking files are treated as read-only provenance records; all downstream datasets and tensors are deterministic derivatives generated by code, not manually edited files.

#### Group 1: The Raw Source Datasets (Immutable Inputs)

These files are the original Car-Hacking Dataset inputs and are never overwritten.

| File | Architectural Role |
|:-----|:-------------------|
| **normal_run_data.csv** | Pure, clean baseline CAN traffic used to establish the healthy grammatical baseline. |
| **DoS_dataset.csv**, **Fuzzy_dataset.csv**, **gear_dataset.csv**, **RPM_dataset.csv** | Traffic logs containing benign background communication with injected malicious frames, used to train the Stage 2 taxonomy classifier. |

#### Group 2: The Processed Datasets (The Engineering Pipeline)

These artifacts are generated by preprocessing logic to isolate supervisory signals and optimize learning quality.

| File | Engineering Function |
|:-----|:---------------------|
| **normal_traffic.csv** | Aggregated corpus of clean traffic extracted from raw logs and normalized for Stage 1 baseline modeling. |
| **attack_traffic.csv** | Isolated malicious frames used exclusively for Stage 2 Random Forest training and attack taxonomy supervision. |
| **normal_traffic_augmented.csv** | **Critical feature:** synthetically expanded benign corpus generated via jitter, stride shifting, and session merging. This augmentation strategy mitigates *Concept Drift* by exposing DistilBERT to a broad manifold of legitimate vehicle operating states, which materially lowers false positives during real-world deployment. |

#### Group 3: The Compiled Model Artifacts (AI Ingestion)

Deep learning systems do not efficiently consume raw CSV text at training scale, so the pipeline compiles dataset outputs into native inference and training artifacts.

| Artifact | Compilation Purpose |
|:---------|:--------------------|
| **vocab.json** | Translation dictionary mapping hexadecimal CAN IDs to discrete integer tokens, including safety-control tokens **[PAD]**, **[MASK]**, and **[UNK]** for robust handling of padding, masked reconstruction, and previously unseen zero-day identifiers. |
| **sequences.pt** | Final compressed PyTorch tensor artifact containing overlapping 64-frame sliding windows; serves as direct memory-mapped model input to DistilBERT and removes repetitive CSV parsing overhead during training. |

## Model Pipeline

### Stage 1 — DistilBERT MLM Training

**Architecture:** `distilbert-base-uncased` backbone with custom embedding layer sized to the CAN vocabulary (replacing the default 30,522-token WordPiece vocabulary).

**Training objective:** Masked Language Modeling — 15% of CAN ID tokens per sequence are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict the correct token from surrounding context.

**Core insight:** By training exclusively on normal traffic, the model internalizes a probability distribution over expected CAN ID co-occurrence patterns. Attack frames inject anomalous IDs that violate these patterns, producing high reconstruction loss — making loss a reliable anomaly signal with no attack labels required.

**Training Hyperparameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|:----------|:------|
| Architecture | DistilBERT (6 layers, 768 hidden dim, 12 attention heads) |
| Custom vocabulary | All unique CAN IDs extracted from training data |
| Window size | 64 tokens |
| Mask rate | 15% |
| Batch size | 64 |
| Learning rate | 2e-5 |
| Optimizer | AdamW |
| Loss function | Cross-entropy (masked positions only) |
| Threshold calibration | 99th percentile of normal traffic losses |
| Hardware | NVIDIA RTX 3050, CUDA 12.6 |

**Stage 1 Artifacts:**

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|:---------|:-----|:--------|
| Model weights | `models/best_model.pt` | Loaded at backend startup for all inference |
| Decision threshold | `models/threshold.json` | Anomaly boundary — sequences above this are flagged |
| Vocabulary | `data/vocab.json` | CAN ID → integer token index mapping |

### Stage 2 — RandomForest Multiclass Training

**Training command:**
```bash
python -m src.train_multiclass
```

**Feature engineering:**
- **TF-IDF representation** over the space-separated string of CAN ID tokens in each flagged sequence window
- **Numeric statistical features:** mean token index, variance, entropy of token distribution, unique token count, sequence length

**Label space:**

| Class | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `DoS` | High-frequency flooding of dominant-priority frames |
| `Fuzzy` | Random CAN ID and payload injection |
| `RPM` | Engine speed spoofing |
| `Gear` | Transmission position spoofing |

**Stage 2 Artifacts:**

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|:---------|:-----|:--------|
| Classifier | `models/multiclass_model.pkl` | Loaded by backend; called only on flagged sequences |
| TF-IDF vectorizer | `models/vectorizer.pkl` | Text feature extractor — must match training version |
| Training metrics | `reports/multiclass_training_metrics.json` | Per-class precision, recall, F1, support |

---

## Evaluation & Metrics

Full evaluation is run by:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

This evaluates both stages end-to-end on a held-out test set and writes structured results to `reports/`.

### Stage 1 — Binary Detection Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| **ROC-AUC** | Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve |
| **Precision** | Fraction of sequences flagged as attack that are true attacks |
| **Recall** | Fraction of true attacks that were successfully detected |
| **F1 Score** | Harmonic mean of precision and recall |
| **False Positive Rate** | Fraction of normal sequences incorrectly flagged as attack |
| **Threshold sensitivity** | Performance sweep across the 95th, 97th, 99th, 99.5th percentile thresholds |

### Stage 2 — Multiclass Attack Classification Metrics

| Metric | Reporting Level |
|:-------|:----------------|
| **Precision** | Per-class (DoS, Fuzzy, RPM, Gear) + weighted average |
| **Recall** | Per-class + weighted average |
| **F1 Score** | Per-class + macro and weighted averages |
| **Confusion Matrix** | 4×4 matrix showing inter-class prediction errors |
| **Support** | Sample count per class in held-out test set |

### Evaluation Report Artifacts

| File | Location | Contents |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|
| `evaluation_metrics.json` | `reports/` | Full Stage 1 + Stage 2 numeric metrics |
| `multiclass_training_metrics.json` | `reports/` | Stage 2 per-class training performance |
| Loss distribution plot | `reports/` | Histogram comparing normal vs. attack reconstruction losses |
| ROC curve | `reports/` | Stage 1 binary detection performance curve |
| Confusion matrix | `reports/` | Stage 2 attack type prediction heatmap |

> All report assets are browsable in the **Reports page** of the React dashboard and served via `/static/reports/{filename}`.

## Full Execution Workflow

Run these steps **in order** when starting from raw data with no pre-trained artifacts.

### Step 1 — Download the Dataset

Download the [Car-Hacking Dataset](https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/car-hacking-dataset) and place all files in `data/`:

```
data/
├── DoS_dataset.csv
├── Fuzzy_dataset.csv
├── gear_dataset.csv
├── RPM_dataset.csv
└── normal_run_data.csv
```

### Step 2 — Data Exploration and Augmentation

Open and run all cells in `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb`.

**Outputs:**

**Outputs:**
- `models/best_model.pt`
- `models/threshold.json`

### Step 5 — Stage 2 Training (Multiclass RandomForest)

```bash
python -m src.train_multiclass
```

**Outputs:**
- `models/multiclass_model.pkl`
- `models/vectorizer.pkl`
- `reports/multiclass_training_metrics.json`

### Step 6 — Evaluation and Report Generation

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

**Outputs:**
- `reports/evaluation_metrics.json`
- Loss distribution plots, ROC curve, confusion matrix in `reports/`

### Step 7 — Start Backend and Frontend

## API Reference

All endpoints are defined in [`backend/main.py`](backend/main.py). Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`

### REST Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Request | Response |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:--------|:---------|
| `GET` | `/` | Root — project info and version | — | `{name, version, description}` |
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness + artifact load status | — | `{status, model_loaded, stage2_loaded}` |
| `GET` | `/stats` | Detection counters since last backend start | — | `{total, attacks, normals, attack_types}` |
| `GET` | `/threshold` | Current Stage 1 decision boundary | — | `{threshold: float}` |
| `GET` | `/vocab/size` | Tokenizer vocabulary size | — | `{vocab_size: int}` |
| `POST` | `/predict` | Single sequence inference | `{"sequence": [int, ...]}` | See schema below |
| `POST` | `/predict/batch` | Batch sequence inference | `{"sequences": [[int,...], ...]}` | `{results: [...]}` |
| `GET` | `/reports/manifest` | List all available report assets | — | `{reports: [filename, ...]}` |
| `GET` | `/static/reports/{filename}` | Serve a report asset (PNG, JSON, HTML) | — | File response |

### Additional Runtime Control Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Request | Response |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:--------|:---------|
| `POST` | `/threshold` | Update Stage 1 threshold at runtime (optional persist to disk) | `{"threshold": float, "persist": bool}` | `{threshold, persisted, threshold_data}` |
| `GET` | `/stream/config` | Get live stream cadence | — | `{interval_ms, frames_per_second}` |
| `POST` | `/stream/config` | Update live stream cadence | `{"interval_ms": int}` | `{interval_ms, frames_per_second}` |

**`/predict` response schema:**

```json
{
  "score": 0.843,
  "is_attack": true,
  "label": "ATTACK",
  "attack_type": "DoS",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "threshold": 0.612,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:23:41.003Z"
}
```

Current `/predict` response payload (runtime shape):

```json
{
  "anomaly_score": 0.843,
  "threshold": 0.612,
  "label": "ATTACK",
  "attack_type": "DoS",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "is_attack": true,
  "processing_time_ms": 7.42,
  "details": {
    "unknown_tokens": 0,
    "unknown_ratio": 0.0,
    "score_margin": 0.231,
    "device": "cuda"
  }
}
```

Current `/reports/manifest` response payload (runtime shape):

```json
{
  "available_files": [
    {
      "name": "confusion_matrix.png",
      "url": "/static/reports/confusion_matrix.png",
      "size_bytes": 123456
    }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "metrics": {
      "accuracy": 0.9712,
      "precision": 0.9753,
      "recall": 0.9272,
      "f1_score": 0.9506,
      "specificity": 0.9899
    }
  },
  "multiclass_metrics": {}
}
```

### WebSocket — `/ws/live`

Connect to `ws://localhost:8000/ws/live` for a continuous real-time inference event stream.

Runtime note: in the current implementation, `/ws/live` streams replay/simulated sequence windows from preprocessed artifacts when a direct CAN capture source is not attached.

**Event payload fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| `score` | `float` | Stage 1 reconstruction loss for this window |
| `is_attack` | `bool` | `true` if `score > threshold` |
| `label` | `string` | `"NORMAL"` or `"ATTACK"` |
| `attack_type` | `string \| null` | Stage 2 class label if attack; `null` if normal |
| `confidence` | `float \| null` | Stage 2 class probability if attack; `null` if normal |
| `threshold` | `float` | Decision threshold active at time of event |
| `timestamp` | `string` | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp |

**Example client connection (JavaScript):**

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000/ws/live");

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.is_attack) {
    console.warn(`ATTACK: ${data.attack_type} — confidence ${data.confidence}`);
  }
};

ws.onerror = (err) => console.error("WebSocket error:", err);
ws.onclose = () => console.log("Stream closed");
```

## Frontend Dashboard

The React dashboard is a single-page application with four views, all driven by the API client in `api/client.ts` and the live WebSocket hook in `hooks/useLiveStream.ts`.

| Page | File | Purpose |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|
| **Dashboard** | `DashboardPage.tsx` | Live anomaly event feed, real-time score chart, attack type distribution, session statistics |
| **Analyze** | `AnalyzePage.tsx` | Manual sequence submission to `/predict`, full result breakdown with Stage 1 loss and Stage 2 label |
| **Reports** | `ReportsPage.tsx` | Browse and view evaluation report assets from `/reports/manifest` |
| **About** | `AboutPage.tsx` | System architecture documentation and model methodology |

**Key frontend implementation modules:**

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `api/client.ts` | Fully typed Fetch/Axios wrapper for every REST endpoint |
| `hooks/useLiveStream.ts` | Manages WebSocket connection lifecycle, automatic reconnection, and event state |
| `layout/AppLayout.tsx` | Sidebar navigation, header, responsive layout grid |
| `vite.config.ts` | Dev server on port 3000; reverse proxy to `localhost:8000` for API calls |
